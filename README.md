This is the official web project for CR8 Agency, built with a modern JavaScript stack to reflect the brand's creative identity and deliver a fast, responsive user experience.

## Overview

The site was designed and developed with performance, clarity, and scalability in mind. In addition to showcasing CR8's work and mission, the website includes an AI-powered chat widget that allows visitors to interact with the brand in real-time.

## AI Chat Integration

An AI assistant is embedded directly into the site as a chat widget. It's designed to engage users, answer questions about CR8 and in general. This makes the site not just a static presentation, but a dynamic touchpoint between CR8 and its audience.
